## 💡 About

**Rodah** (Arabic for "garden") is a fully interactive Arabic e-commerce UI for a plant store. It features a complete shopping cart system with quantity controls, real-time total calculation, toast notifications, localStorage persistence, and category + live search filtering — all built with zero libraries or frameworks.

This is my sixth front-end project and my most feature-complete one yet — the first with a real e-commerce interaction flow from browsing to checkout.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Building a **full cart state system** — tracking items, quantities, and totals in a JavaScript array, then syncing the entire UI on every change
- Combining **search and category filters** simultaneously — filtering a shared product array through two independent conditions at once
- Implementing **localStorage persistence** for cart data, including safe JSON parsing with try/catch for corrupted data
- Designing a **slide-in drawer** using `transform: translateX()` and `visibility` toggling — smoother than `display: none` for animated components
- Creating **toast notifications** that appear and auto-dismiss using `classList` and `setTimeout`
- Using **event delegation** by re-attaching listeners after every `innerHTML` re-render — and understanding why this is a pattern worth replacing with proper delegation later
- Structuring a **real product data array** and rendering the entire UI dynamically from it, keeping HTML clean and data-driven

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Add a product detail modal with description and care instructions
- [ ] Implement a wishlist feature
- [ ] Add quantity selector directly on the product card
- [ ] Replace innerHTML re-render with proper event delegation
- [ ] Rebuild with React — CartContext for global state, ProductCard as a component
- [ ] Connect to a real backend or Supabase for live product data
